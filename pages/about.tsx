        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> My name is Nik and I am a web developer and rock climber. I have a passion for all things tech and love the
            challenge of solving complex problems. In my free time, you can find me at the climbing gym, in the
            mountains, or setting up the latest silly home automation. In a former life, I was a senior hardware
            engineer designing server motherboards, but I gave that all up so I could build websites!

            As a frontend developer, I've worked professionally with React and Angular, and while I don't favor one or
            the other, I strongly prefer Typescript in whatever web project I am working on. I excel when working on
            teams with a strong collaborative culture, and I get the most joy working with others. I enjoy understanding
            the  inner works of how the web actually works, and my goal is to eventually be able to lead teams in
            building scalable, reliable, and usable websites. I also have a strong passion for web accessibility, and
            believe it is paramount to build inclusive and usable websites for all.

            Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find it informative and look forward to connecting with
            you.</p>
